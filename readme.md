# Prop Types

This is a PHP take on the ReactJS Prop Types checking. I made it because I wanted an easier way to validate the type and presence of properties in Phpx components.

## Getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:preprocess/pre-prop-types.git
cd pre-prop-types
composer install
composer test
```

I want to write a blog post about how to use this, practically. When that's done, I will replace this paragraph with a link to the post.
